She received her BA in Philosophy and BS in Biology at California State University, Los Angeles, and also holds an EdM in Mind, Brain, and Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. She is primarily interested in understanding how adolescence may be a sensitive period of enhanced plasticity for social learning. This question has led her to examine puberty, stress, and different types of peer interactions in relation to the developing brain. A former middle and high school teacher, she is interested in the implications of developmental science in clinical and educational contexts. Outside of the lab, she enjoys the gorgeous greenery of Oregon and dabbles in cooking, language learning, and modern dance.</p></div></div><div class="row section-container portrait-container" id="karlena-ochoa_container"><div class="col-sm-3 horz-section-img-wrap portrait-wrap"><div id="karlena-ochoa" imgsrc="Karlena.png" class="portrait-image" height=70%  width=70%></div></div><div class="col-sm-9 horz-section"><h2 class='post-title'>Karlena Ochoa</h2><p><a href="mailto:kochoa@uoregon.edu" class="person-email">kochoa@uoregon.edu</a></p><p>Karlena Ochoa is a 4th year PhD student in the developmental psychology program at the University of Oregon.

Before coming to University of Oregon, Karlena finished her BA in 2014 and MA at California State University San Marcos.</p></div></div><div class="row section-container portrait-container" id="akhila-nekkanti_container"><div class="col-sm-3 horz-section-img-wrap portrait-wrap"><div id="akhila-nekkanti" imgsrc="Akhila.png" class="portrait-image" height=70%  width=70%></div></div><div class="col-sm-9 horz-section"><h2 class='post-title'>Akhila Nekkanti</h2><p><a href="mailto:akhilan@uoregon.edu" class="person-email">akhilan@uoregon.edu</a></p><p>Akhila Nekkanti came to the Prevention Science doctoral program with a B.S. in Neuroscience and is currently studying under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Skowron in the Family Biobehavioral Health Lab. Her current research examines the impacts of early adversity on children’s executive functioning capacities and resting-state neural activity. Akhila is co-mentored by Dr. Mills on her OSLER TL1 project examining the impacts of an intensive, practice-based intervention (i.e., PCIT) on children’s functional brain organization. Her long-term goal is to delineate the type and extent of environmental enrichment necessary for enhancing lasting change in self-regulatory capacity in children facing early caregiving adversity and trauma.</p></div></div><div class="row section-container portrait-container" id="victoria-guazzelli-williamson_container"><div class="col-sm-3 horz-section-img-wrap portrait-wrap"><div id="victoria-guazzelli-williamson" imgsrc="Victoria.png" class="portrait-image" height=70%  width=70%></div></div><div class="col-sm-9 horz-section"><h2 class='post-title'>Victoria Guazzelli Williamson</h2><p><a href="mailto:vgw@uoregon.edu" class="person-email">vgw@uoregon.edu</a></p><p>Victoria is a second-year clinical psychology PhD student interested in social cognitive and brain development across adolescence, with an emphasis on how this development impacts mental health (such as internalizing disorders) and physical health (such as obesity). Victoria takes a mixed methods approach to this research blending experimental with longitudinal and observational work and using tools such as task-based fMRI, clinical interviews, and ecological momentary assessment to form a holistic understanding of this development. Victoria’s most recent work focuses on how adolescents’ views of others interact with their understanding of themselves–and how facets of this cross-talk may relate to risk for internalizing disorders. A long-term goal of her research is to develop interventions and influence policies that equitably promote positive development, wellbeing, and health for all adolescents. <a href="/assets/papers/Guazzelli_Williamson_CV.pdf">CV</a></p></div></div><div class="row section-container portrait-container" id="elizabeth-mcneilly_container"><div class="col-sm-3 horz-section-img-wrap portrait-wrap"><div id="elizabeth-mcneilly" imgsrc="Elizabeth.jpg" class="portrait-image" height=70%  width=70%></div></div><div class="col-sm-9 horz-section"><h2 class='post-title'>Elizabeth McNeilly</h2><p><a href="mailto:emcneill@uoregon.edu" class="person-email">emcneill@uoregon.edu</a></p><p>Elizabeth McNeilly is a second-year doctoral student in Clinical Psychology at the University of Oregon, focusing on the intersection of adolescent development and internalizing psychopathology. In collaboration with Dr. Mills and researchers at UCLA and UC Berkeley, Elizabeth is currently investigating the role of neural and behavioral reward processes in the association of early puberty and internalizing symptoms in the ABCD Study. Under the supervision of Dr. Mills and Dr. Nick Allen, Elizabeth is also exploring linguistic features in daily digital social communication and the associations with well-being and internalizing symptoms in adolescent girls. An overarching aim of her work is to explore the social, cognitive, and affective processes that undergo immense development in the brain during adolescence, conferring potential risk for internalizing psychopathology, but also an opportunity for targeted intervention and the improvement of adolescents’ well-being.</p></div></div><div class="row section-container portrait-container" id="clare-mccann_container"><div class="col-sm-3 horz-section-img-wrap portrait-wrap"><div id="clare-mccann" imgsrc="Clare.png" class="portrait-image" height=70%  width=70%></div></div><div class="col-sm-9 horz-section"><h2 class='post-title'>Clare McCann</h2><p><a href="mailto:cmccann2@uoregon.edu" class="person-email">cmccann2@uoregon.edu</a></p><p>Clare graduated June of 2020 from the University of Oregon with honors in Psychology, minors in Special Education and Women’s Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies.
