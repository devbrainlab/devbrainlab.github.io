Our lab applies longitudinal research methods to investigate the intertwined social, biological, and cognitive processes that underlie the development of skills needed to navigate the social environment. We broadly examine how brain development and social environmental influences interact and impact on social cognitive development during the transition into adolescence. 


Research overview
===============

Brain development 
----------

A fundamental task in neuroscience is to characterize the brainâ€™s developmental course. It is only with this knowledge that we can begin to identify individuals who deviate in neurotypical development and tailor intervention efforts to impact processes when they are most malleable. The lab is engaged in several projects characterizing typical brain development trajectories in longitudinal samples of MRI data. Further, the pace of brain development differs between individuals. We examine how individual differences in structural brain changes and functional brain orgnaization relate to behavior, cognition, and well-being in children and adolescence.

Social navigation
----------

Changes in brain structure reflect developmental tasks, and the prolonged development of certain neural systems reflects a level of plasticity in adolescence. Indeed, the areas of the brain undergoing the most structural change in adolescence are involved in higher-order processes such as complex social cognition. In our lab, we incorporate the particularly protracted development of complex social cognition in neurodevelopmental models of learning, decision making, and behavior.
