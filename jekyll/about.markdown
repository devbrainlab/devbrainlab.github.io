  - title: The developing brain is awesome

    body: Our research investigates how the prolonged course of brain development allows humans to learn how to navigate our complex social environment. We approach our research from a life course history perspective and endeavour to co-create our projects with members of the population we study.

  - title: Science needs to be accessible to all 
    image: /images/glyph/growth.svg
    body: Our lab actively works toward removing barriers to understanding, accessing, and conducting developmental cognitive neuroscience. We make our data, [tools](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/HCP-MMP1_0_projected_on_fsaverage/3498446), and [scripts](https://github.com/devbrainlab) available. We make our papers understandable and accessible without paywalls. We host [workshops](https://abcdworkshop.github.io/) and [hackathons](https://brainhack-eugene.github.io/) to train researchers in conducting rigorous and transparent science on open datasets. Most importantly, we strive to diversify science. This means we apply an [intentional design](https://www.creativereactionlab.com/our-approach) approach to building an inclusive community within the laboratory, and also work with community members outside of the university to include [their voices](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/kathryn-mills) in the design and interpretation of research we conduct.
