    body: Theresa Cheng is an *ABD* doctoral student in Developmental Psychology at the University of Oregon. She received her BA in Philosophy and BS in Biology at California State University, Los Angeles, and also holds an EdM in Mind, Brain, and Education from the Harvard Graduate School of Education. She is primarily interested in understanding how adolescence may be a sensitive period of enhanced plasticity for social learning. This question has led her to examine puberty, stress, and different types of peer interactions in relation to the developing brain. A former middle and high school teacher, she is interested in the implications of developmental science in clinical and educational contexts. Outside of the lab, she enjoys the gorgeous greenery of Oregon and dabbles in cooking, language learning, and modern dance.

    email: akhilan@uoregon.edu
    body: Dr, Akhila Nekkanti came to the Prevention Science doctoral program with a B.S. in Neuroscience and is currently studying under the mentorship of Dr. Elizabeth Skowron in the Family Biobehavioral Health Lab. Her current research examines the impacts of early adversity on children’s executive functioning capacities and resting-state neural activity. Akhila is co-mentored by Dr. Mills on her OSLER TL1 project examining the impacts of an intensive, practice-based intervention (i.e., PCIT) on children’s functional brain organization. Her long-term goal is to delineate the type and extent of environmental enrichment necessary for enhancing lasting change in self-regulatory capacity in children facing early caregiving adversity and trauma.
