Our lab's manager, Lucy Whitmore, had a big week! She submitted her independently-designed and written NSF GRFP application and presented at the [Society for the Neurobiology of Language](https://2020.neurolang.org/?p=schedule) symposium: Capturing developmental brain dynamics: methods for longitudinal language research.
