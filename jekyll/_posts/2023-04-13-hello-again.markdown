A lot has happened these last years! The biggest news is that we are starting a new line of research focused on climate anxiety and nature-based learning in children and adolescents. We are still studying the developing brain, social environments, and social cognition! Some recent news: Victoria Guazzelli Williamson was awarded a $2,000 Center for the Study of Women in Society Graduate Student Research Grant to support her project examining other-oriented social cognition, social status and internalizing disorders in young women! I was selected to be part of the 2023-24 University of Oregon [Sustainability Fellowship Program for Community-Engaged Learning](https://cpfm.uoregon.edu/SustainabilityFacultyfellowship)! I look forward to working with other fellows in the program and connecting with local community organizations. I'll also be developing a new 400-level course for the department on Conservation Psychology.
