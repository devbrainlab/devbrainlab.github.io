The start to the term has been busy. Just this week, we brought our bucket of brains to two different schools! While we usually visit teenagers in high school, we were delighted to visit some third grade classrooms this week, where we made pipe cleaner neurons in addition to giving the kids a chance to touch real brains and ask questions! We'd love to visit more classrooms, so just reach out if you'd like to schedule a visit. In addition to Valerie—a Hui Undergraduate Scholar who joined the lab in Spring—we now have two more RAs: Tyler & Riley, who are working with Victoria on her two intense mentalizing projects! On the social front, the lab also recently visited [Detering Orchards](/images/gallery/Detering2023.jpg) to pick through some pumpkins. I (kate) am looking to take on a new doctoral student this year, so please apply and/or reach out if your research interests align with the lab's future directions.
