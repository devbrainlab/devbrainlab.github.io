Too much happened this summer that we needed to celebrate. We held the five week [ABCD Workshop](https://abcdworkshop.github.io), which was a roaring success. Dr. Theresa Cheng defended her dissertation on July 30, and is moving to Boston to begin her post-doc in [Dr. Erin Dunn's lab](http://www.thedunnlab.com/)! Dr. Karlena Ochoa defended her disseration on August 16th, and is moving to Santa Ana to begin her post-doc at the [University California Irvine STEM Learning lab](https://sites.uci.edu/ucistemlearninglab/)! To celebrate this momentous summer, those of us who were in town took a walk around the river path from the Rose Garden to the Whiteaker Community Gardens. I couldn't be more proud to work with these humans.
