We're all about collaborations in this lab, and I'm excited to share that four papers from four different collaborations have been accepted in the past few weeks!<br> [The first](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929320301444) is a true tour de force empirical project led by Theresa Cheng, where she brought together three different studies to investigate the impact of adversity, abuse, and neglect on adolescent amygdala resting-state functional connectivity.<br> [The second](https://psyarxiv.com/xw7ua/) is an empirical investigation to appear in <i>Cortex</i>, led by [Lia Ferschmann](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/aca/liam/index.html) from the PROMENTA team, investigating how cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression relate to longitudinal structural brain development across adolescence.<br> [The third](https://academic.oup.com/scan/advance-article/doi/10.1093/scan/nsaa166/6024637) is an empirical investigation led by Andrik Becht at Eramus University, replicating some of our previous work and relating social brain development to friendship quality.<br> Finally, last but not least, is a [review and resource paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929320301511) led by Eduard Klapwijk (also at Eramus University), which was the product of a collaboration spurred by a tweet from Eduard proposing a paper full of solutions to increase reproducibility and replicability in developmental neuroimaging.
