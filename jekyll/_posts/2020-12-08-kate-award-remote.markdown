I won a teaching award for adapting my courses to be taught remotely during the spring term. Learn more about the awardees (including Dr. Sara Weston!) [here](https://provost.uoregon.edu/remote-teaching-awards). Adapting my 150-person undergraduate course on developmental psychology to be taught remotely was tough, but I really enjoyed recording short lectures and demonstrations with my two young children.
