This is a demo of all styled elements in Jekyll Now. 

[View the markdown used to create this post](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/barryclark/www.jekyllnow.com/gh-pages/_posts/2014-6-19-Markdown-Style-Guide.md).

This is a paragraph, it's surrounded by whitespace. Next up are some headers, they're heavily influenced by GitHub's markdown style.

# Header 1

## Header 2

### Header 3

#### Header 4
 
A link to [Jekyll Now](http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/). A big ass literal link <http://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/>
  
An image, located within jekyll/images but refer to it from /assets/images as that's where it'll be on the server.

![an image alt text]({{ "/assets/images/gallery/folder1/pexels-photo-3432223.jpeg" | relative_url}} "an image title")

* A bulletted list
- alternative syntax 1
+ alternative syntax 2
  - an indented list item

1. An
2. ordered
3. list

Inline markup styles: 

- _italics_
- **bold**
- `code()` 
 
> Blockquote
>> Nested Blockquote 
 
Syntax highlighting can be used by wrapping your code in a liquid tag like so:

{{ "{% highlight javascript " }}%}  
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}  

creates...

{% highlight javascript %}
/* Some pointless Javascript */
var rawr = ["r", "a", "w", "r"];
{% endhighlight %}
 
Use two trailing spaces  
on the right  
to create linebreak tags  
 
Finally, horizontal lines
