We've had a wonderful few months here. [Dani Beck](https://danibeck.net/) from University of Oslo is wrapping up his two month visit with our lab, and [Barbara Braams](http://www.barbarabraams.nl/research-projects.html) from Vrije University in Amsterdam was here all of May! Lucy's paper, "BrainAGE as a measure of maturation during early adolescence" is under review and available as a [preprint here](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.31.542949v1.abstract). We have brought our [bucket of brains](/images/gallery/laboutreachmay23.jpg) to local schools a few times (reach out if you'd like us to visit your school!). Kellie defended her honors thesis! We have [gone out to celebrate](/images/gallery/labouting0523.jpg) or just enjoy the weather pretty much every week this term. I was [interviewed for a podcast](https://www.dailyemerald.com/multimedia/the-search-for-joy-on-a-walk-with-kate-mills-episode-1/article_1c01d698-f093-11ed-b655-d7b1b4b7a0c2.html) about joy, where I was able to describe some of our recent work while walking along one of my favorite places in Eugene. I got that [tenure](/images/gallery/gotthattenure.jpg). All in all, a great spring term, and I'm looking forward to seeing what the next year brings.
