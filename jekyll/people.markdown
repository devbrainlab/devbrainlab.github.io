    email: vgw@uoregon.edu
    body: Victoria is a clinical psychology PhD student interested in social cognitive development and mental health across adolescence. She is particularly interested in how self- and other-understanding impacts risk for internalizing disorders during adolescence. Victoria takes a mixed methods approach to this research, using experimental and longitudinal studies, clinical interviews, and task-based fMRI. Victoria’s most recent work focuses on how adolescents’ views of others interact with their understanding of themselves–and how facets of this cross-talk may relate to risk for internalizing disorders. A long-term goal of her research is to develop interventions and influence policies that equitably promote positive development, wellbeing, and health for all adolescents.
