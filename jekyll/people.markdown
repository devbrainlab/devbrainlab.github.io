    email: lwhitmor@uoregon.edu
    body: Lucy Whitmore is a graduate student and former lab manager of the Developing Brains in Context Lab. She is interested in how adolescents create flexible behavioral strategies to navigate the world around them, and how these strategies might be affected by external factors. Currently, she is working on a project validating the machine-learning based metric of brain maturity called BrainAGE, as well as a qualitative project focusing on how adolescents think about maturity. Lucy is also excited about science communication and outreach, and working closely with adolescents to answer the questions they're interested in. [CV](/assets/papers/whitmore_cv_aug2022.pdf)
  - name: Victoria Guazzelli Williamson

    email: vgw@uoregon.edu
    body: Victoria is a clinical psychology PhD student interested in social cognitive development and mental health across adolescence. She is particularly interested in how self- and other-understanding impacts risk for internalizing disorders during adolescence. Victoria takes a mixed methods approach to this research, using experimental and longitudinal studies, clinical interviews, and task-based fMRI. Victoria’s most recent work focuses on how adolescents’ views of others interact with their understanding of themselves–and how facets of this cross-talk may relate to risk for internalizing disorders. A long-term goal of her research is to develop interventions and influence policies that equitably promote positive development, wellbeing, and health for all adolescents.

    email: emcneill@uoregon.edu
    body: Elizabeth McNeilly is a clinical psychology PhD candidate studying the intersection of adolescent development, digital mental health, and internalizing psychopathology. Under the supervision of Kate and Dr. Nick Allen, Elizabeth recently published a study that identified dynamic linguistic features of daily social communication (social media, text, email) that relate to depression symptoms and changes in mood in adolescent girls. An overarching aim of Elizabeth’s work is to understand how the social, cognitive, and affective processes undergoing immense development in the brain during adolescence interact with digital contexts to confer not only risk for internalizing psychopathology, but also an opportunity for targeted intervention and the improvement of adolescents’ well-being.
