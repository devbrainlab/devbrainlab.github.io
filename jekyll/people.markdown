    body: Lucy Whitmore is a graduate student and former lab manager of the Developing Brains in Context Lab. She graduated from UC Berkeley with a degree in Cognitive Science. She is interested in how adolescents create flexible behavioral strategies to navigate the world around them, and how these strategies may be affected by social connections and their environment. She is currently working on a project validating the machine-learning based metric of brain maturity called BrainAGE [CV](/assets/papers/whitmore_cv_aug2022.pdf)
  - name: Victoria Guazzelli Williamson

    email: vgw@uoregon.edu
    body: Victoria is a clinical psychology PhD student interested in social cognitive and brain development across adolescence, with an emphasis on how this development impacts mental health (such as internalizing disorders) and physical health (such as obesity). Victoria takes a mixed methods approach to this research blending experimental with longitudinal and observational work and using tools such as task-based fMRI, clinical interviews, and ecological momentary assessment to form a holistic understanding of this development. Victoria’s most recent work focuses on how adolescents’ views of others interact with their understanding of themselves--and how facets of this cross-talk may relate to risk for internalizing disorders. A long-term goal of her research is to develop interventions and influence policies that equitably promote positive development, wellbeing, and health for all adolescents.

    email: emcneill@uoregon.edu
    body: Elizabeth McNeilly is a clinical psychology PhD student focusing on the intersection of adolescent development and internalizing psychopathology. In collaboration with researchers at UCLA and UC Berkeley, Elizabeth is currently investigating the [role of neural and behavioral reward processes in the association of early puberty and internalizing symptoms in the ABCD Study](https://osf.io/7u3jt/). Under the supervision of Kate and Dr. Nick Allen, Elizabeth is also exploring linguistic features in daily digital social communication and the associations with well-being and internalizing symptoms in adolescent girls. An overarching aim of her work is to explore the social, cognitive, and affective processes that undergo immense development in the brain during adolescence, conferring potential risk for internalizing psychopathology, but also an opportunity for targeted intervention and the improvement of adolescents’ well-being.
