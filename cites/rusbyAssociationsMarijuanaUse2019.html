The research is further limited as many relevant studies have small sample sizes. This investigation examines the association between marijuana use (use in the past 30 days) and anxious mood lability (rapid fluctuation in emotional states) during early adolescence (average age 14.4, spring of 8th grade) through midadolescence (10th grade).</p><h4>Cite this paper:</h4> <pre>@article{rusbyAssociationsMarijuanaUse2019,
