However, it is unclear whether BrainAGE tracks with other maturational metrics in adolescence. In the current study, we related BrainAGE to metrics of pubertal and cognitive development using both a previously validated model and a novel model trained specifically on an early adolescent population. The previously validated model was used to predict BrainAGE in two age bands, 9-11 and 10-13 years old, while the novel model was used with 9-11 year olds only. Across both models and age bands, an older BrainAGE was related to more advanced pubertal development. The relationship between BrainAGE and cognition was less clear, with conflicting relationships across the two models. Additionally, longitudinal analysis revealed moderate to high stability in BrainAGE across early adolescence. The results of the current study provide initial evidence that BrainAGE tracks with some metrics of maturation, including pubertal development. However, the conflicting results between BrainAGE and cognition lead us to question the utility of these models for non-biological processes.</p><h4>Cite this paper:</h4> <pre>@article{10.1162/imag_a_00037,
