This observed increase in mentalizing sophistication is thought to aid adolescents in navigating increasingly complex social relationships and contexts. However, developmental science has not measured how mentalizing as a multifaceted construct is applied adaptively in social contexts, or how mentalizing strategies relate to functional outcomes, such as internalizing mental health concerns, in adolescence. This paper includes a review of the literature describing approaches to measure mentalizing strategies during adolescence. We also describe a theoretical perspective that may be harnessed to guide future studies designed to measure the influence of social environmental factors on the development of these mentalizing strategies during adolescence.</p><h4>Cite this paper:</h4> <pre>@misc{williamson_mentalizing_2022,
