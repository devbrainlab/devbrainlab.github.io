Here, we argue that developmental science would particularly benefit from incorporating co-creation into the scientific process given the unique strength of including the perspectives of young people with lived experiences in scientific research. We propose that developmental scientists approach co-created research similarly to other open science practices and provide considerations for working with young people and community organizations in co-created developmental science projects.</p><h4>Cite this paper:</h4> <pre>@article{whitmore_co-creating_2022,
