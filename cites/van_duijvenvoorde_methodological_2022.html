These neurobiological changes are accompanied by significant changes in children’s and adolescents’ cognitive learning. By drawing from studies in the domains of reading, reinforcement learning, and learning difficulties, we present a brief overview of methodological approaches and research designs that bridge brain- and behavioral research on learning. We argue that ultimately these methods and designs may help to unravel questions such as why learning interventions work, what learning computations change across development, and how learning difficulties are distinct between individuals.</p><h4>Cite this paper:</h4> <pre>@article{van_duijvenvoorde_methodological_2022,
