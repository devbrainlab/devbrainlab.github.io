Current research emphasizes individual variability in brain development, including its causes and consequences. Although genetic factors and prenatal and perinatal events play critical roles, calls are now made to also study brain development in transactional interplay with the different aspects of an individual’s physical and social environment. Such focus is highly relevant for research on adolescence, a period involving a multitude of contextual changes paralleled by continued refinement of complex cognitive and affective neural systems. Here, we discuss associations between selected aspects of an individual’s physical and social environment and adolescent brain structural development and possible links to mental health. We also touch on methodological considerations for future research.</p><h4>Cite this paper:</h4> <pre>@article{ferschmann_contextualizing_2022,
