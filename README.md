# Overview

This site is built with **jekyll** and **webpack** and uses **npm** to manage packages and run/build scripts.

* **Jekyll** (https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) compiles the [sass](https://sass-lang.com/) to css, and markdown to html (in `/jekyll`) using liquid templates.
* **Webpack** (https://webpack.js.org/) packages and minifies the site and handles the development server. (see `/config`)
* **npm** (https://www.npmjs.com/) installs necessary packages and houses the scripts used to build, serve, and deploy the site (see `package.json`, particularly `"scripts"`)
